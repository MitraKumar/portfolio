# Portfolio

This site is a comprehensive showcase of the projects and technologies I've worked with, reflecting my journey and growth as a software developer.

## Technology

- React / NextJs
- TailwindCSS
- MDX

## Design & Development

Built with **Next.js**, this site offers a seamless user experience and is deployed on **Vercel** for optimal performance and reliability.
For content management I have used plain old markdown files. Used a library `next-mdx-remote` for managing this.

*Fun note, This page is actually written in markdown file. ðŸ˜‰*
